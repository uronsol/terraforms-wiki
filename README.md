# Introduction to Terraforms

### Introduction to Terraforms

**Terraforms is an NFT project created by Mathcastles, a digital studio co-founded by 0x113d and xaltgeist.**

**Individual Terraforms are a NFT that represent a piece of open source metaverse property in a 20 level structure known as the Hypercastle. Anyone is free to build on top of Terraforms as long as you adhere to the License.**

**While most NFTs store their data off-chain with decentralized services such as Arweave or IPFS, Terraforms is a "hyper on chain" project which persists all of its metadata and rendering information on the Ethereum blockchain.** &#x20;

**Should I buy a Terraform?**

No! Itâ€™s entirely reasonable and possible to pick up one that you like because you like it, enjoy the animated vibes, and maybe dig into the details later - or not.&#x20;

\
Additionally you do not need to own a Terraform to extend or build games, services, or other products that use Terraforms.
